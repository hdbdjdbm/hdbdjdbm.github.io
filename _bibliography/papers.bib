  abstract = {As increasing sample sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have shown great potential in personalized medicine with disease risk prediction, prevention and treatment. However, the PRS constructed using European samples becomes less accurate when it is applied to individuals from non-European populations. It is an urgent task to improve the accuracy of PRSs in under-represented populations, such as African populations and East Asian populations.In this paper, we propose a cross-population and cross-phenotype (XPXP) method for construction of PRSs in under-represented populations. XPXP can construct accurate PRSs by leveraging biobank-scale datasets in European populations and multiple GWASs of genetically correlated phenotypes. XPXP also allows to incorporate population-specific and phenotype-specific effects, and thus further improves the accuracy of PRS. Through comprehensive simulation studies and real data analysis, we demonstrated that our XPXP outperformed existing PRS approaches. We showed that the height PRSs constructed by XPXP achieved 9\\% and 18\\% improvement over the runner-up method in terms of predicted R2 in East Asian and African populations, respectively. We also showed that XPXP substantially improved the stratification ability in identifying individuals at high genetic risk of Type 2 Diabetes.The XPXP software and all analysis code are available at github.com/YangLabHKUST/XPXPSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  journal={The American Journal of Human Genetics},
  abstract={We present a unified statistical framework (XPA) to improve the prediction accuracy of  human traits using multi-ancestry genetic data.   Paired with innovations in data structure and algorithm design, our framework is highly scalable, with both computational cost and memory storage linear to the sample size and number of predictors. In practice, XPA can analyze 3 million variants from 430K samples with only 385 Gb memory usage in 54.5 hours. In a Chinese cohort, our method achieves 7.3%-198.0% accuracy gain for height prediction in terms of R2 compared to existing methods.},

  title={{BIVAS}: a scalable {Bayesian} method for bi-level variable selection with applications},
  abstract={In this article, we consider a Bayesian bi-level variable selection problem in high-dimensional regressions. In many practical situations, it is natural to assign group membership to each predictor. Examples include that genetic variants can be grouped at the gene level and a covariate from different tasks naturally forms a group. Thus, it is of interest to select important groups as well as important members from those groups. The existing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often computationally intensive and not scalable to large datasets. To address this problem, we consider variational inference for bi-level variable selection. In contrast to the commonly used mean-field approximation, we propose a hierarchical factorization to approximate the posterior distribution, by using the structure of bi-level variable selection. Moreover, we develop a computationally efficient and fully parallelizable algorithm based on this variational approximation. We further extend the developed method to model datasets from multitask learning. The comprehensive numerical results from both simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate the advantages of BIVAS for variable selection, parameter estimation, and computational efficiency over existing methods. The method is implemented in R package “bivas” available at https:// github.com/ mxcai/ bivas. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

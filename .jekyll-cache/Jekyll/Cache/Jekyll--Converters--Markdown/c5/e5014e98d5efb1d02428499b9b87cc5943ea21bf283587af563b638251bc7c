I"þ<p>No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install-just your content. Markdown, Liquid, HTML &amp; CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment. Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.</p>

<p>Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-jekyll">What is Jekyll?</h2>

<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.</p>

<p>You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.</p>

<p>Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your projectâ€™s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHubâ€™s servers for free.</p>

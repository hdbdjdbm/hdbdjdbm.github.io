I"“<p>Hi! I am Sal, web designer &amp; developer at WowThemes.net. The free items I create are my side projects and <strong>Mundana for Jekyll</strong> is one of them. You can find <strong>all the work I release for free <a href="https://www.wowthemes.net/category/free-themes-templates/">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>You have my permission to use the free items I develop in your personal, commercial or client projects. If youâ€™d like to reward my work, I would be honored and I could dedicate more time maintaining the free projects.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
